update of one of the files in the hackypi repository that copies netstat and IP info to text files.  Now instead of saving to the host computer it saves the files to the hackpi and also stops it going full screen and shuts itself down when finished.  Still trying to work out how to save it to the SD and hopefully integrate that.
