All scripts are for Windows computers.

wifipassv1.0 copies the wifi SSID's and passwords from a windows pc and saves them to a file in the root of the user directory called Log.txt.
Still trying to get the file to save to the hackypi.

wifipassv2.1 does the same thing but in a different way.  It saves all the Wi-Fi profiles to a file on the hackypi and then gets connection details for all SSID's and saves them to a file on the hackypi.

wifipassv2.2 just saves the current Wi-Fi connection details to the hackypi
