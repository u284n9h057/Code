These Ducky scripts are tailored for the DuckyPi.py script that runs on the Hackypi.  Change the name to 'duckyscript.txt' and put on the HackyPi drive in the root folder.
Not many yet but I will be adding to it all the time as I test the scripts or write new ones.
Many of these scripts will also have a HackyPi version written in circuitpython in my HackyPi folder, normaly if it has a version number on the end of the filename.  I think they run a bit faster in circuitpython than running them as a Ducky script.
